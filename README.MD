# onHit

Trigger system-trusted NFC events without a physical tag by Xposed.

## Overview

**onHit** is an Xposed module that triggers **system-trusted NFC dispatch events**
without requiring any physical NFC tag.

This project is **not** an NFC card reader, writer, or hardware emulator.

Instead, onHit works at the **Android framework layer**, hooking into the system
NFC service to inject fabricated `Tag` objects and invoke real NFC dispatch logic,
making the system and applications believe that a genuine NFC tag has been detected.

## What onHit is NOT

- NOT an NFC reader
- NOT an NFC writer
- NOT Host Card Emulation (HCE)
- NOT hardware-level NFC emulation

onHit does not communicate with NFC hardware at all.

## How it works

onHit hooks key classes and methods inside the Android NFC framework
(e.g. `NfcService`, `NfcDispatcher`, `DeviceHost`, etc.) using Xposed.

By intercepting and invoking internal NFC dispatch flows, it:

- Constructs or modifies `Tag` / `TagEndpoint` related objects
- Injects controlled UID, technology lists, and extras
- Triggers genuine system NFC callbacks
- Allows apps to receive NFC intents as if a real tag was presented

All NFC events generated by onHit are **trusted by the Android system**,
because they originate from inside the framework itself.

## Use cases

- NFC-related security research
- Reverse engineering NFC-based apps
- Testing NFC logic without physical cards
- Bypassing hardware dependency in controlled environments
- Framework-level NFC behavior analysis

## Requirements

- Rooted Android device
- Xposed / LSPosed environment
- Android system with AOSP-like NFC framework (vendor ROMs may vary)

## Limitations

- Strongly dependent on Android version and vendor NFC implementation
- Some OEM frameworks may modify or restrict NFC internals
- Not intended for production use
- No guarantee of compatibility across devices or ROMs

## Legal & Ethical Notice

This project is intended for **research, learning, and testing purposes only**.

Do NOT use this project to:
- Bypass security mechanisms without authorization
- Attack or impersonate real-world NFC systems
